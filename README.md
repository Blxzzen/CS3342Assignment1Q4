# Question Instructions
```
4. (50pt) Assume C++ has been modified into C+? where nested comments are allowed; this concerns
   only multiline comments: /* ... */. Write a Python program com rm.py to remove all comments,
   including single line ones (//...\n) from a C+? program. The program should work as follows:
   $ python dcom_rm.py inputC.cpp inputC_rm.cpp
   where inputC.cpp is any (correct) C+? program and inputC_rm.cpp is the same program with all
   comments removed.
   You are not allowed to use any regular expression capabilities of Python, or external libraries, as
   that would defeat the purpose of the question.
```


# Usage:
`python com_rm.py inputC.cpp inputC_rm.cpp`
